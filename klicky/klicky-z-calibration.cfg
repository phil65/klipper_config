nozzle_xy_position: 234, 349.5
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the Z endstop.
switch_xy_position: 229.5, 332
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switchbody, clicking on
#   the Z endstop.

switch_offset: 0.38
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   This needs to be fined out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
max_deviation: 2.5
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
clearance: 2 
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration or 20mm if it is still zero.
speed: 50
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.

probing_retract_dist: 2
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: false
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
start_gcode: ATTACH_PROBE
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
before_switch_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode: DETACH_PROBE
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
